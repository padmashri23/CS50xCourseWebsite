        <p>Hi!</p>
      </p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and sci-fic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
